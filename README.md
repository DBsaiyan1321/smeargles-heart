# Smeargle's Heart 

Smeargle's Heart is a social media website that is centered around art, and it's full of "imaginations" (posts). You can share your own imaginations, as well as look at other people's imagination. If you like someone's art, you can "like" it. Let's say that you shared an imagination but now you want to edit it or delete it, you have the power to do so. If all of this sounds pretty familiar, that is because Smeargle's Heart is a clone of the website "DeviantArt". 

Here is a [link](https://smearglesheart.herokuapp.com/#/) to Smeargle's Heart.

Technologies that I used include:

Doing the likes were difficult for me. There were some interesting "if" conditions, and this feature taught me a lot more about how React components work. Go one about the challenges, what you tried, and how you figured it out. 

Something that was surprisingly difficult for me to figure out was how to get the username of the artist who made the imagination to show up on the index and show page. Go one about the challenges, what you tried, and how you figured it out.

For my code snippets, show of the like logic.
